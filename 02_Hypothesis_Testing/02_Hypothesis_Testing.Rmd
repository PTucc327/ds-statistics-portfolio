## What is Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis Testing is used to compare a group means to determine if they are statistically different. 

There are a few methods for Hypothesis Testings:

### One-sample t-test
One-sample T-test is used to compare one group mean to a known value

### Independent samples t-test
Independent t-tests compare 2 separate group means 

### Paired Samples t-test
Paired Samples t-test compares means of the same group but from before and after certain conditions
